<h2>Running SASI Runner</h2>

This page describes how to run the SASI Runner program.

<ol>
    <li>Read the instructions.</li>
    <li>Select an input data folder:
        <ol>
            <li>Click the 'select input' button.</li>
            <li>Navigate to the name of the input folder you wish to use, and click on the folder to highlight it.</li>
            <li>Click the 'Open' button.</li>
            <li>You should see "Selected '/path/to/your/file' as input." in the log pane.
        </ol>
    </li>
    <li>
        Specify an output file:
        <ol>
            <li>Click the 'Specify output' button.</li>
            <li>Choose where you want to put the output file, and what you want to call it. Make sure the filename ends with '.zip' .
            <li>Click the 'Save' button.</li>
            <li>You should see "Selected '/path/to/your/file' as output." in the log pane.
        </ol>
    </li>
    <li>
        Configure the model resolution by checking fields. If a field is a checked, you will be able to group results by that field. For example, if the 'energy' field is checked, you will get separate result rows for each energy level. Please note that increasing the resolution by enabling more fields can *greatly* increase run times and output file sizes.
    </li>
    <li>
        Run the runner:
        <ol>
            <li>Click the 'Run' button. You should see log messages start to appear in the log pane.</li>
            <li>Wait for the runner to finish. This can take some time.</li>
            <li>When the runner is complete the progress bar will stop. The final message in the log pane should be something like 'SASI Run completed, output file is: '/path/to/the/output.zip'</li>
        </ol>
    </li>
</ol>
